<p>I am interested in Network Virtualization. I am working on resource allocation problems
for Network Function Virtualization, 
Virtual Function placement and routing problem, Elastic management of resources for virtual functions.
I am also looking at “serverless computing” and “microservices”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advisers: Prof. Ibrahim Matta</li>
  <li>RINA is a new network architecture that is based on the fundamental principle that networking is inter-process communication (IPC). It recurses the IPC service over different scopes.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Advisers: Dr. Fareed Zaffar</li>
  <li>The project deals with computing the shortest path for vehicles using heuristic data and active query caching. Road-side units (RSU) were used to assign weights to different paths and A-star algorithm was then used to compute the shortest path using distance-plus-cost heuristic function.</li>
